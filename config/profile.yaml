  biography: |
    Hi! I'm <strong>Natasha</strong>, an <em>iOS engineer</em> who loves building <em>thoughtful and useful products</em>. 
    Currently, I work at <em>Grab</em> on the <em>Core/Platform team</em>.

    With a background in <em>Computer Science from BINUS</em> and learning through the <em>Apple Developer Academy</em>, I've worked on projects like <i>Mimicri</i> (launched on the App Store with 300+ users in its first week) and <i>Aura</i>, which won <em>GEMASTIK 17</em> and the <em>Microsoft Accessibility Hackathon</em>.
    <div class="my-2"></div>
    Outside of work, I enjoy <em>painting and reading</em>, which help me stay creative and refreshed. 
    Feel free to <a href="mailto:natasha.radika@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out</a> to connect.
